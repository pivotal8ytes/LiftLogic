# LiftLogic
A video feed aggregation script to combine mp4 video files and sync up their times exactly to catch action shots from different angles from different devices.


How to start:
- adjust settings in the scripts to your liking
- Start recording with as many iphones as you want. you don't need to start the recordings at the exact same time. More space is better, 64 GB or better for the long run.
- Use the Google Application I created on a 4th iphone or a webpage, to mark timestamps of moments in your lifting that you want to capture later.

How to combine and sync up timestamps:
- On windows, Run the file system monitor (Script adapted from: BigTeddy 05 September 2011)
- Run the file system monitor
- Drop your video files into the monitored folder. 
- The rest will output combined video files for you. The logic will line up the timestamps of the video files to perfectly align with the timestamps you captured on the Google App.
